# Boilerplator

This is a boilerplate system that I have made that generates
my own custom boilerplates for my own development needs

you can use this program yourself by
setting a custom alias to the `app.js` file
on `bash_profile`

```
alias summon="DIRECTORY_NAME/app.js"
```

(has been tested and used for linux, it hasn't been tested on other operating systems)
